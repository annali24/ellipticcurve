This year, our project focuses on researching the properties of Weierstrass Elliptic Curves and computing its torsion over the rationals. Weierstrass elliptic curves are represented in the form y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C, where A, B, and C are integers.

## How it Works

The calculator will ask you to input three integers for A, B, and C which represents the variables in the elliptical curve equation y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C. This is the affine version of the equation. 
**The Algorithm**
First, by utilizing Nagell Lutz's Theorem, we will calculate the discriminant and determine the multiples. These would be possible y-values of the equation. Then, we check if y^2 would divide the discriminant and take those values and plug it into the cruve to see if we get an integer value for x. 

Secondly, we take the possible points we found and go thorugh the process of generating all the points.
